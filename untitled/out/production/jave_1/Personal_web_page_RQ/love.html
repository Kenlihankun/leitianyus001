                  Badminton is an indoor sport in which small balls of feathers and cork are hit over a net with long netted rackets. Badminton is played on a rectangular court with nets in the middle of the court. Both sides use various techniques and tactics such as serving, hitting and moving to hit the ball back and forth on the net, so as not to make the ball fall in their own effective area or make the other side hit the ball wrong.</p>
