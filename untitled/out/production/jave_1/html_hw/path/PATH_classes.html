  <b>Gentle Hatha Yoga</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded
  foundation in the prac- tice of yoga, this 60 minute class
  of poses and slow movement focuses on asana
  (proper alignment and posture), pranayama (breath work), and
  guided meditation to foster your mind and body connection.
  <br><b>Vinyasa Yoga</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Although designed for intermediate to advanced students,
  beginners are welcome to sample this 60 minute class that focuses
  on breath-synchronized movementâ€” you will inhale and exhale as
  you flow energetically through yoga poses.
  <br><b>Restorative Yoga</b><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   This 90 minute class features very slow movement
  and long poses that are sup- ported by a chair or wall.
  This calming, restorative experience
  is suitable for students of any level of experience. This
  practice can be a perfect way to help rehabilitate an injury.
