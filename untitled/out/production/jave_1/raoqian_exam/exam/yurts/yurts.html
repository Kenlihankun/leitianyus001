    <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
    <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
    <p>
      Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas
      walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
    </p>
    <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
    <p>
      Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. The luxury camping
      experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities
      are located in the lodge.
    </p><h3>What should I bring?</h3>
    <p>
      Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack comfortable walking
      shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.
